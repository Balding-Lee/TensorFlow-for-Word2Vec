These codes come from book "Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow", chapter 3.

I translated many English annotations into Chinese. I didnâ€™t touch the ones that I thought my translation was not accurate enough. I also added a lot of Chinese annotations, which are my own thoughts after reading the code.

Since my `matplotlib's` version is higher than the author's, which caused a trouble that I don't have `plt.cm.spectral`. And it also caused a lot of `warnings` when running the function plot.
